We **strongly** suggest you using the following folder structure.
This allows you to easily update or downgrade the artifact without messing with your base files.
C:/.../Desktop/fivem-server
├── <artifact number>
│   └── FXServer.exe
├── txData (created automatically)
└── <server_name>
    ├── resources
    └── server.cfg

This folder structure doesn't need to be in your Desktop.
If your username has spaces or special characters then you need to put it on C:/.
