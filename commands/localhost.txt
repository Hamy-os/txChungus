:question: **How to access txAdmin from outside your VPS:**
:one: Open port 40120 on your OS firewall (eg Windows Firewall);
:two: Open port 40120 on your Hosting Company firewall (eg OVH, AWS, Google, etc);
:three: Open `http://your-public-ip:40120/` in your browser (do not use `localhost`).
:warning: **If this does not work, then it's an issue with your networking and NOT txAdmin!**
