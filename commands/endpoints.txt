For any errors like `No endpoint_add_* found inside the file.`
Add the following to the **top** of your server.cfg
```md
# Only change the IP if you're using a server with multiple network interfaces, otherwise change the port only.
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30120"
endpoint_add_udp "0.0.0.0:30120"
```
You can change the port as you like but do **not** change the 0.0.0.0
