Even though **txAdmin** comes with the fxserver artifacts, ZAP Hosting doesn't support it and has no interest in doing so :clown: 
We recommend you choosing a *good* VPS provider:
- <https://www.ovhcloud.com/> **(recommended)**
- <https://cloud.google.com/compute/> **($300 free trial!)**
- <https://www.digitalocean.com/>
- <https://www.vultr.com/>
Seriously, why use them!? 
**It's not even the cheapest option!** (google literally gives you $300 free trial)
