If task 5 [connect_database] is failing when setting up PlumeESX, there is an easy fix!
:one: Download and install a MySQL server program (such as nginx, XAMPP, etc.)
:two: Run the software and start the service called "MySQL".
:three: Restart the setup of PlumeESX and that task will continue with no issues.
If task 6 then fails, enable the "wipe existing databases" option, and resume PlumeESX installation.
It will overwrite your existing database if you chose the same name.
